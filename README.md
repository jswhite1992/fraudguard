## *Installation Guide*

If you don't have Python, JupyterLab, or Anaconda installed on your operating system:

-**[Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

-**[Install JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)**

-**[Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)**


**1. Conda 'dev' Environment** - To run the main application you will need to create a new enviornment that will be compatible with this application, type and enter the following. You will still use the previous steps' command to activate:

        conda create -n env_name python=3.7 anaconda

Activate conda enviorment by running the following function:

        conda activate env_name 

**2. Other Libraries** - It was mentioned earlier that the other required libraries should already be installed with the Anaconda package. To confirm installation for these libraries, you can either use the 'conda list' command followed by the library name to confirm installation. Or, you can install the libraries which will either install successfully or if already installed, will result in a 'requirement already satisfied' message. Listed below are the commands to install each library if needed:
        
        pip install sklearn
        pip install plotly
